## Rules to contribute

1. Go to the code section (home page of repo).
2. Click on "Branches", written just below the name "Exodia-IIT-Mandi".
3. Create your personalized branch by clicking on the new Branch green button on the upper right side, write its name and enter.
4. After creating the new branch, you can see it on the screen, click on it.
5. You can verify that you opened your own branch by seeing your branch name just below "Exodia-IIT-Mandi", after you open your branch after step 4.

Then follow the following steps:

1. Go to the repo, download its zip folder by clicking on the green "code" button on the upper right side.
2. Extract the zip folder, and open it using VS Code.
3. Open a new terminal in VS Code and write the following commands one by one:
    > **NOTE:** Here "temp" is my branch name, make sure you replace it with your branch name.
    > **NOTE:** Also make sure not to make any changes, first you have to link your VS Code local branch with your GitHub branch.
    ```bash
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Cultural-Council-IIT-Mandi/Exodia-IIT-Mandi.git
    git fetch origin temp
    git checkout -b temp origin/temp
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push origin temp
    ```
4. At the end, you should see "Everything up-to-date" in the terminal.
5. Then for just checking, make a little change to the `zPageUpdate` file.
6. Then you have to push these changes by doing the following:
    - On the left side in VS Code, you have Source Control.
    - Click on it.
    - Inside the message box, write a message for your commit.
    - Then press commit.
    - If something appears, press the OK button.
7. Then check on your browser whether that change appears or not. If it appears, Balle Balle! Go and start developing. If not, contact Piyush 🫠 .
8. Whenever you change code and push to your branch, you will see on the home page of your branch on the TOP - "CREATE PULL REQUEST".
    - Click on it.
    - Write the name and description and press create PR.
    - Let us know to merge it. We will review the code and merge your PR.
